# These are build options for dragonfly. They are loaded
# by vellum when a build task is run and are made available
# in the config namespace in the build file. This means that
# if the variable "foo" is defined here it's possible to use the value
# as "%(foo)s" in the build spec. You usually don't need to care about
# that, but you might want to tweak values defined underneath.
# Known options
#
#
#   Project: the project name
#   perl: path to perl executable
#   jsdoc: path to jsdoc.pl script
